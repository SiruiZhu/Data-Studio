# Project name
The US is suffering less international students especially Chinese students over past few years

## Description 
This project mainly focus on research on Chinese studnets in the US, using visa datas gathering from 
US government, and analyze it using pandas and visualize it with matpotlib. 
My main questions are:

- What is the trend over the years for the US to issue student visas to Chinese? What's the ups and downs? 
- Do some background reading, and figure out what's the reason for it.
- What is the visas issued to Chinese students' percentage of the total visas?
- Does the same trend happened with all the internationsl students numbers? 

## Process and Updates
###  Process
I downloaded a csv from US Homeland security, it has data from 1997 to 2007 of the US issued all types of 
data to other countries. 

It has several sheets in one Excel. So I get filter them one by one from different sheets. I just get the 
F-1 visa type and "China" as country.

Also the total number of F-1 for that year, want to compare the  percentage of the US issued F-1 visa 
numbers to China. 

The international student numbers csv I directly downloaded from Quarts, they've done a piece about this 
topic before. I've also find the date source, which is nice to use. 

### Updates
For my first revision, I styled the charts to look better. 
For my second revision, I got feedbacks from instructor and coursemates, so I followed their feedback, I changed
the legend and and the size of the title.
