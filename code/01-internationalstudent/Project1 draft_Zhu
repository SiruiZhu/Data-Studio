Title: The US is suffering less internationsl students especially Chinese students over past few years.
Data source: US Homeland security; U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement

Work I've done:

I downloaded a csv from US Homeland security, it has data from 1997 to 2007 of the US issued all types of data to other countries. 
It has several sheets in one Excel. So I get filter them one by one from different sheets. I just get the F-1 visa type and "China" as country.
Also the total number of F-1 for that year, want to compare the  percentage of the US issued F-1 visa numbers to China. 

The international student numbers csv I directly downloaded from Quarts, they've done a piece about this topic before. I've also find the 
date source, which is nice to use. 



Findings:

Surprisingly, the student visas US issued to Chines and international has dropped dramatically after 2015.

The factors might be various. The first one, according to some background reading, is because of the student visa policy to China.
It changed to period of studnets visa ftom one-year to five-years on 2014 OPEC. Obama announced that. So the student visa application 
is less than before. Also because the immigration policy during Trump era, so students are more likely to go to Austrilia or Canada. The high 
tuition fee is also another factor might influence the result. 


Improvements:
1. Need to do one with international student's influence on the US economical impact or so. Which is more straightforward. 
2. Improve the graph a bit, like the way to show the data. Maybe highlight the drop line part, and have a label saying the reason for that.
3. Not just Chinese students, maybe look into the different continents, like "Asia", "Europe" etc.
