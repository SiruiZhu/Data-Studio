# Project

I read in news that is about China is having a population risk, that young people are not willing to
have children. While on social media, people in my age tend to have more pressure, like marriage, 
housing, children, wage and so on. Let's say 90s in China now is going through hard time really! 

This project is mainly focus on analyzing how Two-child policy effect on female fertility rate over 
the decade, also will have a research on 90s pressure of supporting elderly. The population structure 
in China is changing, and aging problem is coming.
